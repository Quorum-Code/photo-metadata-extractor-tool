## Institution's ID

WorldCat assigns a unique identifier to each institution.
This ID can be used for specifying or broadening searches.

### Finding an Institution's ID

You can find WorldCat's institution registry [here](https://registry.worldcat.org/registry/Institutions).
Search for your institution and navigate to its dedicated page.
Once there you'll find a number at the end of the URL.

If you're having trouble visit [here](https://registry.worldcat.org/registry/Institutions/285).
At the end of the URL you should see **285**, which is Cal Poly Humboldt's institution ID.
